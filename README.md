# CCM
# This project is to implement Accelerated reactions in LAMMPS, an opensource molecular dynamics simulation.
# It utilizes python scripts which track atoms, and tell the simulation which atoms to add restraint force to.
# I have picked up this project midway through, and am debugging the code my predecessor wrote.
